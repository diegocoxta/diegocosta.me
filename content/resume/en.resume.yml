    summary:
      I was invited by Suno Research to develop the company's first mobile application. I worked closely with the product team to gather requirements, detail the roadmap and backlog. In addition, I was responsible for defining the technologies to be used, guiding two junior engineers through code reviews and mentoring, setting up accounts on the Apple Store and Google Play, and building the entire CI/CD process.

      I started at Sanar as a Software Engineer, tasked with building new products and introducing the company to the world of mobile apps using React Native. With a challenging deadline and a lean team, I successfully delivered a free app to help medical students prepare for their residency exam.

      Furthermore, I became a reference in frontend and guided several teams and products on appropriate technologies and methodologies. I led the overhaul of all streaming portals using React and GraphQL and was responsible for hiring and retaining entire frontend teams.
