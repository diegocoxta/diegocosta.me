## ⚙️ Software and Services

- **Google Drive**: I use a 2TB storage plan to backup and sync all my files.
- **Google Domains**: Currently I use it to register my domains, but I previously used Namecheap.
- **Google Workspaces**: Unfortunately, I pay for it to set up custom domains for my Gmail account.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: I work with it to host my MongoDB databases. It is my primary choice for creating new personal projects.
- **Docker**: I'm using it to keep my machine clean without installing all the development tools I need for work.
- **Vercel**: I work with Vercel as my primary hosting service for my personal projects, including this blog.
- **Github**: Github is my primary version control system. I use it to host my code, mainly as private repositories. I also use it to host GitHub Pages and create pipelines using GitHub Actions to deploy anything.
- **ChatGPT**: I use ChatGPT to help me with anything. My primary use is as an English grammar checker, as English is not my primary language. Previously, I used Grammarly.
- **Obsidian**: I'm trying to use Obsidian as my primary note-taking solution. I'm using it with the Git extension to keep my notes safe on my GitHub account. Previously, I used Notion.
- **Yousician**: I'm using Yousician to learn how to play bass! It's very fun and easy to understand. I love gamification tools like this.
- **Stremio**: I'm using Stremio to watch movies that I cannot find on any streaming service. I really try not to use pirated content; I subscribe to every streaming service I know. However, sometimes only the good old torrent can help me with older or harder-to-find movies.
