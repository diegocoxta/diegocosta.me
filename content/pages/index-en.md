I'm an engineering manager who loves the intersection of computers and people. I spend my days helping tech teams reach their maximum potential.

My areas of expertise include engineering leadership, people management, software engineering, and D&I. I'm currently working as an Engineering Manager at @nubank, and I'm always happy to talk about tech or people management.
