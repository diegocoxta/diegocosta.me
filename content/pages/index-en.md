I'm an engineering manager who loves the intersection of computers and people. I spend my days helping tech teams reach their maximum potential.

My areas of expertise include engineering leadership, people management, software engineering, and D&I. I'm currently working as an Engineering Manager at @nubank, and I'm always happy to talk about tech or people management.

I have extensive experience with Javascript-based technologies such as React, React Native, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Node, but I'm always eager to learn new things. Currently, I'm learning about Clojure and its ecosystem, some distributed systems concepts, improving my english and learning how to play bass.
